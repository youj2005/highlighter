# Automatic Highlighter PyTorch Project

This project uses my own notes to train a LM model topredict which words/tokens will be highlighted and which color/class it will be highlighted. The model is built on 'google/electra-base-generator' and the classifciation head is built using PyTorch. The encoder model is frozen for the first 3 epochs of training to train the classification head and subsequently the encoder is unfrozen to fine-tune the encoder. The model achieves ~73% macro-average accuracy and ~70% micro-average accuracy. The data is also resampled to include equal amounts of each highlight color (4 colors)

The model exists in the highlight.py file and all helper methods and objects are wrapped in helper.py
